Basic CRUD with Node.js, MongoDB and AngularJS.
=========================

List, create, read, update and delete documents using AngularJS $resource on the front end, basic Node.js API on the back end and MongoDB.

It is assumed that you have a MongoDB server that does not require authentication running locally on your machine on port 27017. This can always be changed in app.js if you want to use something like MongoLab.

Run "npm install" to install "mongodb" Node.js module dependency.

This code is for instructional purposes only and should not be used in production due to major security inconsiderations.
